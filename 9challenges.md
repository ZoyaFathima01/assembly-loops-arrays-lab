This lab was difficult since I had to manually control loops and counters using registers like EBX and ECX, which necessitated paying close attention to jump conditions and assembly instructions.  It was challenging to handle memory locations and data quantities precisely while working with arrays.  The absence of complete symbolic information made debugging with GDB challenging as well; I had to carefully examine register values and memory content one step at a time.  To confirm that the largest element was accurately recognized, several runs and careful stepping through the code were required.  Overall, in spite of these difficulties, the lab enhanced my knowledge of assembly language and debugging techniques while also giving me a better grasp of how low-level programming functions.
